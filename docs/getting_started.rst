Getting Started with pymchelper
===============================

.. rubric:: Brief overview of pymchelper and how to install it.

Introduction
============

Let us assume you are running detailed particle transport simulation using Fluka MC code.
Your simulation consists of two different estimators: particle fluence and deposited energy.
To get high statistics run is parallelised into 100 different jobs, each producing 2 binary files
(that gives 200 binary output files, typically following ``*_fort.*`` pattern). 

pymchelper comes with **convertmc** program which simplifies postprocessing of such binary data.

To convert all binary files into two text files (one for energy and one for particle fluence) type ::

    convertmc txt --many "*_fort.*" 

Two new files will be created: `21.txt` and `22.txt` which can further processed.

In case estimated value has form of scored-value vs distance it can be plotted as typical `Y vs X`  plot.
Same thing might be done if 2-D distribution of scored value is obtained - then a heatmap type plot can be produced.
In order to directly get such plots you can type::

    convertmc image --many "*_fort*" 

Two new PNG files will be created which can be directly opened, for example

.. figure:: 21.txt.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: map to buried treasure

These are just basic examples. To learn more about additional features, proceed to :doc:`User's Guide </user_guide>`. 
Among these features are:

* reading binary ``*.bdo`` files generated by SHIELD-HIT12A code
* reading binary ``*_fort*`` files generated by FLUKA
* writing PNG images (1 and 2D plots)
* writing tabulated text files
* writing gnuplot scripts
* calculating standard error when averaging many files


Quick Installation Guide
========================

First be sure to have Python framework installed, then type::

    pip install pymchelper

In case you don't have administrator rights, add ``--user`` flag to ``pip`` command.
In this situation converter will be probably installed in ``~/.local/bin`` directory.
