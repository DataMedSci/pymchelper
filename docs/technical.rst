Release management
------------------

New releases are created using Github `release feature <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases>`_. 
First a release branch is created (e.g. `release/v1.10.10`). Then a new release is added together with appropriate tag.
Github actions will automatically trigger making and uploading of pip and deb packages, 
as well as `relase assets <https://github.com/DataMedSci/pymchelper/releases/latest>`_.
