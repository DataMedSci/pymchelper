WHAT IS THIS ?
==============

pymchelper is a toolkit for manipulating output and input files of particle transport codes,
such as FLUKA and SHIELD-HIT12A.
It provides a command line program, called *convertmc* which simplifies process of converting binary output
files to graphs, tabulated plain data files (which can be open by MS Excel) and other formats.
Toolkit can also serve as a library in Python language, which can be used to read data from binary files
into convenient Python objects. This allows further data processing using other Python tools and libraries.


Installation
============

First be sure to have Python framework installed, then type::

    pip install pymchelper

In case you don't have administrator rights, add ``--user`` flag to ``pip`` command.
In this situation converter will be probably installed in ``~/.local/bin`` directory.

To be able to use ``tripcube`` converter install also ``pytrip98`` Python package using ``pip``.

For more detailed instruction, see `installation guide <INSTALL.rst>`__.

Documentation
=============


To convert single SHIELD-HIT12A output file, called ``dose.bdo`` file to a PNG image run::

    convertmc image dose.bdo plot_dose.png

Let us assume you ran SHIELD-HIT12A on a cluster specifying 5 different estimators in ``detect.dat``
and running 100 parallel jobs. As an output you have 500 ``.bdo`` files.
convertmc can automatically discover which files belong to which estimator and automatically
generate 5 output files.
To convert all ``*.bdo`` files to a set of PNG images you shouldn't specify output file name, just run::

    convertmc image --many "*.bdo"

The same output format as in standard convertmc converter,
shipped with SHIELD-HIT12A code can be achieved with ``txt`` command.
In this case text file with 4 columns will be saved.

Reduced text output (i.e. only two columns for 1D scoring) can be produced with ``plotdata`` command.
Following command will generate text data file which can be digested by gnuplot and accompanying gnuplot scripts::

    convertmc gnuplot --many "*.bdo"


TRiP98 binary ``.dos`` cubes (two files: text ``.hed`` and binary ``.dos``) can be generated with ``tripcube`` command.
It will produce output only for ``MSH`` and ``VOXMESH`` SHIELD-HIT12A scorers.
