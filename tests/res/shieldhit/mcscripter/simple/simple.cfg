#### -------- RESERVED KEYS -------------
# TDIR is the directory where the base template is located relative to where this config file is located.
TDIR = template

# WDIR is the working directory to be created, relative to the location of this config file.
# Note that user defined keys may be specified here.
# Keys which were specified with the _MIN, _MAX _STEP suffixes will be treated as float with three digits after dot.
# Non-existing directories will be created accordingly
WDIR = wdir/${NAME}

# Files which will be copied from TDIR into the working directories which were created. Comma-separated list.
FILES = beam.dat

# Some files do not change across the working directories. Here you can use symlinks instead:
SYMLINKS = geo.dat, mat.dat, detect.dat

# Finally a special key for energy spread: DE_ will always hold E_ * DE_FACTOR given below.
# E.g. this is a 1 % energy spread:
DE_FACTOR = 0.01

#### -------- USER KEYS -------------
# Constants which will not vary over the working directories may be given like this:
NSTAT = 100000
NSAVE = 50000
DIV = 2.5

#### -------- USER KEY TABLES -------------
# Variables may be given as a table.
# First row contains a list of keys, and the subsequent rows are the directories which may be created.
# any key with the suffixes _MIN _MAX and _STEP are will be treated as a range, creating more iterations.
# this can be used for e.g. looping ower energies as in the example below:
NAME        JPART    Z   NUCL
1H              2    1   1   
4He            24    2   4
