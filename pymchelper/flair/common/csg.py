    Convert the FLUKA Boolean expression to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
    Since the normalization routine does not accept the +/- as signs to
    objects, the routine is converting the leading - to @- (Universe minus)
    where the special symbol @ is treated as the universe.
    Furthermore the leading + is ignored as well as the leading | which is
    accepted by fluka.

    WARNING: No check is done for the correctness of the expression apart
             from the parenthesis nesting

    ie.
           A+B         -> A B +
          (A+B)|C      -> A B + C |
          (A|B)|C+D|E  -> A B | C D + | E |
          -A           -> @ A -
          -(-A)        -> @ @ A - -

    The routine is using the same array for returning the Reverse Polish
    expression, since the format is more compact.
    This is generally true apart one case -A -> @ A -

    Priorities are treated as:
        Operator  Priority         In     Out
        --------  --------        ---     ---

    Algorithm
     Consider the expression as a train moving on a railroad with a
     T-shape, where each token is one wagon

                         <-  (A|B)|C+D
         ------------.   .------------

                       |
                      S|
                      t|

                      c|
                      k|

     Each wagon to move from the Exp-End to the RPN-End it has to make
     a stop first in the Stack-End. Before entering in the stack, the
     priority-IN will be checked against the objects in the stack.
     All top-most objects currently present in the stack with
     higher priority-OUT will be transfered from the stack to the
     RPN-End. Apart from the opening parenthesis ( which is discarded.

     Example:
     (1)                         A+B|C (1)
     (2) A                        +B|C (2)
